# Applicative Validation

just a fancy word for collecting error messages ;-)

Compared to Railway Oriented Programming (ROP), Applicative Validation (AV) is a different approach to
handling errors. 

- ROP: stop at the first error and return the error. A short-circuit approach.
- AV: Collect all errors encountered.

This project compares 2 c# libs:

- LaYumba
- LanguageExt
