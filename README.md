# Applicative Validation

just a fancy word for collecting error messages ;-)

Compared to Railway Oriented Programming (ROP), Applicative Validation (AV) is a different approach to
handling errors. 

- ROP: stop at the first error and return the error. A short-circuit approach.
- AV: Collect all errors encountered.

This project compares 2 c# libs:

- [`LaYumba` Library developed for the book "Functional Programming with C#")](https://github.com/la-yumba/functional-csharp-code)
- [`LanguageExt` LanguageExt: most popular functional library for C#)](https://github.com/louthy/language-ext)

## Learning LanguageExt

I am still having problems porting the example from `LaYumba` to `LanguageExt`.

Maybe somebody can help me?
